In an ideal world the following file extensions should not be allowed through your eMail gateway. This list isnâ€™t universal and may not be suitable for every organisation but instead should work as a guideline. You may find your business actually needs a particular file extension for their business, thats fine.

PreventRansomware suggests the following files should never be allowed through an eMail gateway:

.LNK
.PS1
.EXE
.BAT
.SH
.ISO
