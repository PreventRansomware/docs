# Privilege Escalation and Credential Theft

When an attacker first gains their initial foothold on a network, they will most likely find themselves executing code as a low privileged user, perhaps an account used for general office work that has been phished with a malicious Excel document disguised as a business invoice. 
To inflict maximum damage, exfiltrate lots of data and encrypt the majority of systems, the attackers will need higher privileges unless they have been lucky and landed an administrator account from the get-go.
