# Which EDR?
    
PreventRansomware is an impartial and unsponsored source of cyber security education, but our guidance sometimes advocates buying cyber security tooling to solve security problems. Most of our advice can be implemented for free or cheaply, but as it stands, EDR isn’t one of them.   
  
The PreventRansomware team has had personal success with CrowdStrike and Windows Defender For Endpoint. We have personally seen both of these tools stand up well in real-world security breaches and simulations, but you shouldn’t take our word for it. We encourage you to undertake your research and never blindly believe what a vendor tells you. The EDR space is crammed with vendors, essentially doing the same thing.
