# Introduction
Ransomware is chalked up to be a complex threat to modern enterprises. Attackers infiltrate and cripple computer networks across the spectrum indiscriminately; hospitals, schools, factories, councils, utilities and of course government to name just a few.   
These attacks are often followed by blog posts from prominent security vendors explaining why this ransomware event was more sinister and advanced than the last.

**However**, just like everybody else, ransomware gangs want the most reward for the least amount of work.
This means most ransomware gangs aren't using sophisticated attack methods; they want to take the path of least resistance, i.e. exploiting common and easily fixed misconfigurations. **PreventRansomware.io** intends to help system administrators to fix these misconfigurations via education from our 100% free, clear and concise documentation which should require no security expertise to implement.


If you follow this documentation step by step to the end, your network **will be able to fend off the majority of today's ransomware attacks**, and you most likely won't have to spend any money.

For those who are not big on reading long-form documentation or donâ€™t have the time, we have condensed our information down into a top-five controls list and a helpful checklist PDF. If you already have a competent sysadmin or security team, you might be able to implement the proper controls quickly without trawling the entire set of documentation.
